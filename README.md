# TranslateDemo

This is a sample application that utilizes Google's Translate API from Google Cloud Services: https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs

To make this project work, simply clone, use pod install, and plug in your personal API key. The key is a constant inside of the TranslateWebService.swift file. Replace the "enter-key-here" with the key you would like to use.
